## Knowledge

### Minigames
A minecraft minigame is a game played within minecraft that has automation
to facilitate that game. Automation can be done with redstone, command blocks,
mods, or server plugins.

### PVP
PVP stands for player vs player. It describes when players are battling other
players, as opposed to entities, which are game generated, like creepers and zombies.

### Survival Games
Minecraft survival games is a minigame that mimicks the hunger games movies.
Players spawn in a circle around the cornucopia, which is made up of chests with
useful items in them. Players win by utilizing items from the chests and their
pvp skills to become the last player standing.

### Block Hunt / Prop Hunt
Minecraft prop hunt, also known as block hunt, is a hide and seek minigame where
one player is the seeker, and all other players are disguised as blocks. To win,
players need to place themselves into the environment in a convincing manner so that
the seeker cannot find you. If the seeker does not find all block players in time,
the remaining blocks win. When played with more than 2 players, blocks discovered by
the seeker also become seekers.

### Skyblock
Minecraft Skyblock is a minigame in Minecraft where you are placed on an a
floating island with limited resources. Using those resources, the goal is to create
a thriving island by utilizing the properties of minecraft. For example, you
typically start with a cobblestone generator to mine infinite generator.

### Cobblestone Generator
A cobblestone generator in Minecraft takes advantage of the rules of Minecraft
to generate infinite cobblestone. If the downstream lava flow hits water, it turns
into cobblestone. To make a cobblestone generator, place a water and lava source
block within contained spaces several blocks apart, with the lava at or above the
water. Extend a channel from the lava source to the water without letting the water
reach the source block. Once the lava touches the water, it will turn into
cobblestone. If done correctly, that block can then be mined, which would trigger
the generation of another cobblestone block, without spilling water or lava.

### KitPVP
Minecraft kitpvp is a minigame where players select a kit, join an arena, and
fight to the death. Kits are pre-defined eqipment and weapons that prepare players
for battle.

### Splegg
Minecraft splegg is a minigame where players are on a platform a blocks, and
players can throw eggs from their inventory to break the platform. The last player
still on the platform is the winner.

### Plugins
A Minecraft server plugin is modular executable program, typically written in Java,
that can control elements of the game. They are typically used by Minecraft servers
to automate games, authentication, chat, permissions, land protection, and more.
They cannot be used to change the game itself on the client side; for that you
need client mods.
